SEAker is a 3D hidden object game set in different marine biomes in the Philippines, including mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. Players are given a list of creatures to find, which changes depending on the playable creature. The game combines the hidden object genre with puzzle elements and encourages players to learn about marine ecosystems through an in-game almanac. The game is developed using Unreal Engine 5, featuring Nanite and Lumen technologies for high-quality graphics and lighting.
